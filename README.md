# Welcome to Martin Zanaj's Github 

In this interface, you will find links to homeworks and projects that I have completed as a result of my master's degree in data science at the University of Michigan. The goal is to showcase the different topics and skills that I've been able to acquire and develop. Most of the work is indeed my own, but it is imperative to mention the many resources such as books, videos, and online documentation that I have resorted to in order to better my understanding and ultimately compete the assignments.  

## Master's Courses UMICH

**STATISTICAL LEARNING: LINEAR REGRESSION**

The course is an overview of Regression, and its application through R. This is a master's course. As a result, it attemps to cover both theory & practice with a depth that allows for a more than necessary understanding of liner models. This was my first encounter with R and Linear Regression. Perhaps, this is one of the topics I am most fond of given it was my introduction to the world  of data science- a "first love", so to speak.

|-|-|-|
|__Skill__| R, RMarkdown Reporting, Data Modeling & Analysis |
|__Topics__| linear regression, ANOVA, diagnostics, Huber's robust regression, LAD, model selection (Mallow's Cp, Adjusted R^2, Ridge, Lasso), Binomial & Poisson regression |
|__Repository__| https://github.com/mzanaj/Linear-Models-with-R |

   
**DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTICS WITH PYTHON**

This course surveyed some of the tools and frameworks currently popular among data scientists and machine learning practitioners in academia and industry. The first half of the course consisted of an accelerated introduction to the Python programming language, including brief introductions to object-oriented and functional programming styles as well as tools for code optimization. The second half of the course surveyed tools for handling structured data (regular expressions, HTML/JSON, databases), data visualization, numerical and symbolic computing, and large-scale distributed computing.
